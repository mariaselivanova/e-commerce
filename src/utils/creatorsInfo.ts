    bio: [
      `Maria, a Moscow native, adores three things in life: cats, exploring new places, and coding.`,
      `At first, programming was just a way to unwind after her 9 to 5 job. However, she decided to turn her coding hobby into a full-time career.`,
      `The past six months at RS school have been both fun and challenging. She tried to do her best all while traveling throughout South America. Attempting to meet project deadlines amidst the Amazon jungle? No problem at all.`,
